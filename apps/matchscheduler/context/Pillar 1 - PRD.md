**Status:** In Development  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive product specification for AI-driven development with clear user states, permissions, and performance requirements

# Description

MatchScheduler is a web application designed to eliminate the headache of scheduling matches for gaming teams. Instead of endless back-and-forth on Discord, this tool provides a simple, visual way for teams to compare availability and find the perfect time to play.

## The Problem

Coordinating a group of players to find a common time for a match is time-consuming and often chaotic. Trying to manage this across multiple teams using chat applications like Discord leads to missed messages, confusion, and frustration.

## The Solution 

This tool provides a centralized platform where:

- Players can set their availability on a simple weekly grid.
- Team leaders can instantly see a combined view of their team's schedule.
- Anyone can compare their team's availability against any other team to find overlapping free times.

The goal is not to be a full-fledged tournament platform, but to do one thing perfectly: **make it incredibly easy to find out when a match can happen.**

## Core Features

- **Visual Availability Grid:** Set and view availability for 2 weeks at a glance.
- **Team Management:** Create a team, invite players with a simple code, and manage your roster.
- **Availability Comparison:** The key feature! Select an opponent (or multiple) and instantly see all the time slots where both teams have enough players to start a match.
- **Discord & Google Login:** Simple and secure authentication for easy onboarding.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Authentication)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## 3. Core User Journeys

### 3.1 First-Time User Journey

**How They Discover It:**
- **Discord Spam**: Most likely - our whole community lives on Discord currently
- **Podcast Feature**: I'll do a news/podcast show with one of the community guys to showcase the tool and raise immediate awareness
- **Tournament Admin Promotion**: I'll talk with tournament admins to promote it before tournaments as a tool to help teams meet deadlines

**First Impressions:**
- Should be self-explanatory - we're solving ONE specific problem and solving it well
- Sharing individual availability → team collective availability → team vs team comparison
- The interface should immediately communicate this simple purpose

**Their First Week:**
1. Login with Google (everyone has it)
2. Join/Create team (single modal, quick process)
3. Start adding availability for next 4 weeks
4. Check if teammates have done the same
5. Maybe try comparing with another team if both have data

**The Key Challenge:** How to make them keep updating their availability week after week. This is the real product challenge - initial adoption is easy, sustained usage requires:
- Team leader pressure
- Tournament deadlines  
- Visible value (seeing your team's schedule fill up)
- Social pressure (being the only one not updating)

**Important Realization:** The tool succeeds even if used ONLY for internal team availability. While my vision is team-vs-team match finding, the tool is perfectly adequate as just a team availability overview. This is actually the primary use case, with opponent matching as a bonus feature.

---

### 3.2 Actual Usage Pattern (Not Daily)

**Reality Check:** This isn't Facebook - users won't visit daily. Once you've set availability for 4 weeks, you only return to:
- Amend your schedule when things change
- Check your team's collective availability
- Find matches with specific opponents

**Typical Session Flow:**

**For Regular Members:**
1. Get Discord message: "Update your availability!"
2. Open MatchScheduler, see current availability
3. Toggle a few slots that changed
4. Maybe check if enough teammates available for practice
5. Close tab - total time: 2-3 minutes

**For Match Scheduling (Leaders mostly):**
1. Tournament context: "We need to play Team X by Sunday"
2. Check comparison view with Team X
3. See matching slots where both teams have players
4. Click slot to see details (which players available)
5. Contact other team leader
6. Total time: 5-10 minutes

**Tournament Context Matters:**
- Tournaments have stages with deadlines
- Teams know their next 2-3 opponents in advance
- This creates urgency to find match times
- The tool helps meet deadlines without last-minute panic

**"It Takes Two to Tango":**
- Individual value: Set your availability ✓
- Team value: See when your team can play ✓
- Full value: Find matches with opponents (requires BOTH teams participating)
- This network effect is both the challenge and opportunity

---

### 3.3 Team Leader Journey

**Initial Setup:**
1. Create team (becomes leader automatically)
2. Set team name, team tag (4 chars), divisions, max players
3. Get 6-character join code
4. Post in team Discord: "Join MatchScheduler - code: ABC123"
5. Upload team logo (optional but adds legitimacy)
6. Start nagging people to join and set availability

**Ongoing Management:**
- **Weekly Ritual**: Post in Discord "UPDATE YOUR AVAILABILITY"
- **Before Matches**: Check if enough players available for important games
- **Tournament Prep**: Compare with upcoming opponents
- **Roster Maintenance**: Remove inactive players, regenerate code if needed

**Match Coordination Workflow:**
1. Check comparison view for specific opponent
2. See matching time slots
3. Click slot → see both teams' available rosters
4. **Contact Other Leader** (This is where Discord integration matters)
5. Confirm match time
6. Post back to team Discord

**Discord Integration Decision Point:**
- **Option being considered**: Require Discord account linked to contact other leaders
- **Why**: Avoid building a messaging system (unnecessary complexity)
- **How it might work**: Click "Contact Leader" → Opens Discord DM or copies username
- **Benefit**: Keeps communication in existing channels
- **Not decided**: Should ALL members be able to contact other leaders, or just leaders?

**Leader Authority Matters:**
- Even in cooperative/friendly teams, someone needs final say
- Can remove players who don't participate
- Can regenerate join code if shared too widely
- Can transfer leadership if going inactive

---

### 3.4 Community Adoption Journey

**Phase 1 - Early Adoption:**
- A few progressive teams start using it
- They see immediate value for internal scheduling
- Word spreads: "We use this tool, it's actually helpful"

**Phase 2 - Tournament Push:**
- Tournament admins recommend it
- "Use MatchScheduler to avoid scheduling conflicts"
- Deadline pressure drives adoption

**Phase 3 - Network Effect:**
- Teams can't find matches because opponents aren't on platform
- "We need to play you but you're not on MatchScheduler"
- Social pressure to join increases

**Phase 4 - Critical Mass:**
- Most active teams are using it
- Becomes the default way to schedule matches
- Not using it = making things harder for everyone

**Adoption Challenges:**
- Some teams comfortable with Discord chaos
- Getting consistent weekly updates (not just one-time setup)
- Both teams need to participate for match-finding value
- No immediate penalty for not updating

**Why It Should Stick:**
- Solves real pain point (last-minute scheduling scrambles)
- Works as team-only tool (doesn't require full adoption)
- Tournament deadlines create recurring need
- Simpler than Discord polls or shared spreadsheets
- Leaders can enforce participation

## 4. Feature Specifications

### 4.1 Availability System

**Core Concept:** Players mark themselves available for specific time slots. Teams can see collective availability and find match times.

#### 4.1.1 Grid Structure
- **Time Slots:** 30-minute intervals from 18:00 to 23:00 CET (11 slots per day)

- Click behavior: Empty space = select slot, [+X] button = show overflow

**Comparison View Mode:**
- Shows matches where your team + opponents meet minimum thresholds
- Displays opponent team logos or 4-char tags (toggle in grid tools)
- Same overflow: [EQL] [PURG] [DIV1] [+2]
- Click behavior: ANY click on matching slot opens comparison modal
- Empty slots show no matches

- Real-time match highlighting as teams update availability

---

### 5.2 Cold Paths (Can Show Loading - < 2 seconds)

**Team Operations:**
- Creating teams, joining teams, leaving teams
- Player removal, leadership transfer
- Join code regeneration (actually instant, but acceptable if not)

**Profile & Settings:**
- Logo uploads (can show progress)
- Profile updates (name, initials)
- Discord account linking (OAuth flow)
- Team settings changes (divisions, max players)

**Initial App Load:**
- First-time authentication
- Initial data population
- Cache warming

---

### 5.3 Data Caching Strategy (Pre-load Everything)

**On App Load:**
```javascript
// Cache everything (~188KB total)
const allTeams = await loadAllTeamData();        // ~28KB
const allAvailability = await loadAllAvailabilityData(); // ~160KB
// Enables instant browsing and comparisons
```

**Cache Content:**
- All team basic info (names, rosters, logos, divisions)
- All availability data for all teams (4 weeks)
- Total: ~188KB - very reasonable for modern browsers

**Smart Cache Freshness:**
```javascript
// Check cache freshness with server timestamps
POST /checkFreshness
{
  teams: {
    "team123": "2025-07-08T15:30:45Z", // Last known timestamp
    "team456": "2025-07-08T14:22:10Z"
  }
}

// Response identifies only stale teams
{
  staleTeams: ["team123"], // Only this needs refresh
  freshTeams: ["team456"]  // This is current
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates most loading states
- Smart refresh of only stale data (few KB vs 188KB)
- Instant team browsing and comparison setup

---

### 5.4 Real-time Update Architecture

**Direct Component Subscriptions:**
```javascript
// Components manage own Firebase subscriptions
onSnapshot(doc(db, 'teams', teamId), (doc) => {
  TeamInfo.updateUI(doc.data()); // Direct, no middleware
});

// Event coordination (not data distribution)
onSnapshot(collection(db, 'eventLog'), (snapshot) => {
  EventHandler.route(event); // Simple routing to affected components
});
```

**Activity-Based Listener Management:**
```javascript
// Tab visibility-based cleanup and recovery
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
  if (!document.hidden) {
    checkSystemHealth(); // Silent refresh if needed
  }
});
```

**Listener Lifecycle:**
- **Activate:** When clicking [Compare Now]
- **Maintain:** During Team View ↔ Comparison View switching
- **Cleanup:** New team selection, tab inactive 5+ minutes, user leaves
- **Auto-resume:** Tab visibility detection triggers freshness check + restart

**Real-time Propagation:**
- Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
- Firebase real-time propagation (100-500ms acceptable)
- Automatic rollback on failures
- Silent background recovery through tab visibility

---

### 5.5 Error Recovery & Cache Management

**Automatic Recovery:**
- Tab visibility triggers health checks
- Silent background refresh without UI disruption
- Listeners restart automatically when user returns
- No page reloads or loading spinners needed

**Memory Management:**
- Pre-load strategy works due to bounded dataset (300 players, 40 teams)
- Activity-based cleanup prevents memory leaks
- 5-minute inactivity timeout for listener cleanup
- Smart refresh avoids re-downloading entire cache

**Performance Validation:**
- 188KB total cache size negligible for modern browsers
- Selective refresh (few KB) vs full reload (188KB) optimization
- Real-time updates: 100-500ms propagation acceptable
- Hot paths: < 50ms for all user interactions

### 5.6 Event Logging System

#### Purpose & Philosophy
The event logging system tracks all significant activities within MatchScheduler, providing a comprehensive audit trail for community analytics, debugging, and future features like activity feeds. Events are separated into two categories for better organization.

#### Event Categories

**Team Lifecycle Events** - Track team creation, status changes, and archival:
- `TEAM_CREATED` - When a new team is formed
- `TEAM_INACTIVE` - When a team has no activity for 14+ days
- `TEAM_ACTIVE` - When an inactive team is reactivated
- `TEAM_ARCHIVED` - When the last member leaves a team

**Player Movement Events** - Track player actions within teams:
- `JOINED` - Player joins a team (via join code or as founder)
- `LEFT` - Player voluntarily leaves a team
- `KICKED` - Player removed by team leader
- `TRANSFERRED_LEADERSHIP` - Leadership changes hands

#### Collection Structure

**Collection:** `/eventLog/{eventId}`

```javascript
{
  // Unique, human-readable event ID
  eventId: "20250709-1430-slackers-team_created_X7Y9",
  
  // Core identifiers
  teamId: "team_abc123",
  teamName: "Slackers",
  type: "TEAM_CREATED",
  category: "TEAM_LIFECYCLE",  // or "PLAYER_MOVEMENT"
  timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
  
  // Optional fields based on event type
  userId: "user_xyz789",  // Present for player events, optional for team events
  
  // Player details (only for PLAYER_MOVEMENT events)
  player: {
    displayName: "John Doe",
    initials: "JDO"
  },
  
  // Event-specific metadata
  details: {
    // Varies by event type - examples below
  }
}
```

#### Event ID Format
Event IDs follow a human-readable pattern for easy debugging:
- Format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-teamname-eventtype_XXXX`
- Example: `20250709-1430-slackers-team_created_X7Y9`
- Components:
  - Date/time for chronological sorting
  - Team name (cleaned, lowercase, max 20 chars)
  - Event type (underscored)
  - Random 4-char suffix for uniqueness

#### Event Type Specifications

**TEAM_CREATED**
```javascript
{
  type: "TEAM_CREATED",
  category: "TEAM_LIFECYCLE",
  // NO userId - this is a team-centric event
  details: {
    divisions: ["1", "2"],
    maxPlayers: 10,
    creator: {
      displayName: "John Doe",
      initials: "JDO"
    }
  }
}
```

**JOINED** (Including Founder)
```javascript
{
  type: "JOINED",
  category: "PLAYER_MOVEMENT",
  userId: "user_xyz789",
  player: {
    displayName: "John Doe",
    initials: "JDO"
  },
  details: {
    role: "member" | "owner",
    isFounder: true,  // Only true for team creator
    joinMethod: "created" | "joinCode"
  }
}
```

**LEFT**
```javascript
{
  type: "LEFT",
  category: "PLAYER_MOVEMENT",
  userId: "user_xyz789",
  player: {
    displayName: "John Doe",
    initials: "JDO"
  },
  details: {
    wasLastMember: false,
    previousRole: "member" | "owner"
  }
}
```

**KICKED**
```javascript
{
  type: "KICKED",
  category: "PLAYER_MOVEMENT",
  userId: "user_xyz789",  // The kicked player
  player: {
    displayName: "John Doe",
    initials: "JDO"
  },
  details: {
    kickedBy: "user_abc123",  // Leader who performed the kick
    kickedByName: "Team Leader"
  }
}
```

**TRANSFERRED_LEADERSHIP**
```javascript
{
  type: "TRANSFERRED_LEADERSHIP",
  category: "PLAYER_MOVEMENT",
  userId: "user_xyz789",  // New leader
  player: {
    displayName: "New Leader",
    initials: "NLD"
  },
  details: {
    fromUserId: "user_abc123",
    fromUserName: "Previous Leader"
  }
}
```

**TEAM_INACTIVE**
```javascript
{
  type: "TEAM_INACTIVE",
  category: "TEAM_LIFECYCLE",
  // NO userId - automated system event
  details: {
    lastActivityAt: timestamp,
    inactiveDays: 14
  }
}
```

**TEAM_ACTIVE**
```javascript
{
  type: "TEAM_ACTIVE",
  category: "TEAM_LIFECYCLE",
  userId: "user_xyz789",  // User who triggered reactivation
  details: {
    reactivationTrigger: "availability_update" | "roster_change",
    inactiveSince: timestamp
  }
}
```

**TEAM_ARCHIVED**
```javascript
{
  type: "TEAM_ARCHIVED",
  category: "TEAM_LIFECYCLE",
  userId: "user_xyz789",  // Last member who left
  details: {
    reason: "last_member_left",
    finalMember: {
      displayName: "John Doe",
      initials: "JDO"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Implementation Requirements

**Event Creation:**
- All events created server-side via Cloud Functions
- No direct client writes to eventLog collection
- Use transactions to ensure event creation is atomic with the action

**Dual Event Pattern:**
When a team is created, generate TWO events:
1. `TEAM_CREATED` - The team lifecycle event
2. `JOINED` - The founder joining as owner

**Security Rules:**
```javascript
match /eventLog/{document} {
  // Anyone authenticated can read events
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Only Cloud Functions can write
  allow write: if false;
}
```

**Helper Functions:**
- `generateEventId(teamName, eventType)` - Creates readable event IDs
- `logTeamLifecycleEvent(db, transaction, eventType, eventData)`
- `logPlayerMovementEvent(db, transaction, eventType, eventData)`

#### Future Use Cases

**Activity Feed:** Display recent team/community activity
**Analytics:** Track player movement patterns, team stability metrics
**Debugging:** Complete audit trail for support issues
**Historical Queries:** "Show all teams this player has been on"

#### Performance Considerations

**Write Performance:**
- Events written during existing transactions (no extra operations)
- Use batch writes when creating dual events

**Read Performance:**
- Index on: teamId, userId, type, category, timestamp
- Compound indexes for common queries (e.g., team + timestamp)

**Storage:**
- Event documents are small (~500 bytes each)
- At 300 players with moderate activity: ~1000 events/month
- Well within Firestore free tier limits

## 6. UI/UX Requirements

### 6.1 Sacred 3x3 Grid Layout System

**The layout structure is IMMUTABLE - it never changes across all screen sizes and features.**

#### Grid Structure
```css
.main-grid {
  display: grid;
  
  /* HYBRID SCALING for sidebars:
     - 15% of viewport width for proportional scaling
     - Never smaller than 12.5rem (200px) - usable minimum
     - Never larger than 18.75rem (300px) - prevents excessive width
     
     Why "hybrid"? Combines fixed boundaries with proportional scaling
     - 1080p (1920px wide): 15vw = 288px ✓ perfect fit
     - 1440p (2560px wide): 15vw = 384px → clamped to 300px max
     - Small (1280px wide): 15vw = 192px → bumped to 200px min
  */
  grid-template-columns: clamp(12.5rem, 15vw, 18.75rem) 1fr clamp(12.5rem, 15vw, 18.75rem);
  
  grid-template-rows: 5rem auto auto;     /* Fixed header, content adapts to contents */
  gap: 0.75rem;                           /* Tighter spacing for more content area */
  max-width: 85rem;                       /* Prevents ultra-wide stretching */
  margin: 0 auto;                         /* Centers on very large screens */
}
```

#### Panel Layout Map
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────┐
│ TOP-LEFT    │ TOP-CENTER      │ TOP-RIGHT   │
│ User Profile│ Week Navigation │ Team Filters│
├─────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────┤
│ MIDDLE-LEFT │ MIDDLE-CENTER   │ MIDDLE-RIGHT│
│ Team Info   │ Grid Week 1     │ Favorites   │
├─────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────┤
│ BOTTOM-LEFT │ BOTTOM-CENTER   │ BOTTOM-RIGHT│
│ Grid Tools  │ Grid Week 2     │ Browse Teams│
└─────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

#### Panel Rules
1. **Components own their panel interior only** - Never modify panel dimensions
2. **Fixed grid positions** - No components can change their assigned panel
3. **Overflow handling** - Each panel handles its own scrolling/truncation
4. **Flexbox for internal layout** - Components use flexbox within their panel

#### Why This Works for Gaming Setups
- **1080p majority**: Optimized for 1920x1080 (most common gaming resolution)
- **Scales to 1440p**: Side panels cap at 300px, preventing wasted space
- **Multi-monitor friendly**: Max-width prevents stretching on ultrawide displays
- **Quick glancing**: Compact layout lets players check availability between matches
- **Discord alongside**: Leaves room for Discord on second monitor

### 6.2 Hybrid Scaling Strategy

**Critical Lesson Learned:** Previous scaling issues were solved with hybrid approach combining viewport units with rem scaling.

#### Base Font Size Scaling
```css
:root {
  /* Base: 16px at 1920px viewport */
  font-size: clamp(14px, 0.833vw, 20px);
}
```

#### Scaling Unit Requirements
| Unit Type | Use Case | Example | Required |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| `rem` | Most sizing (scales with root) | `padding: 1rem` | **MUST USE** |
| `em` | Relative to parent font | `margin: 0.5em` | Acceptable |
| `px` | Borders, minimum sizes | `border: 1px solid` | **ONLY for borders** |
| `%` | Relative widths within panels | `width: 100%` | Component internals |
| `vw/vh` | Full viewport references | `height: calc(100vh - 60px)` | Grid system only |

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Never use pixels for sizing. All padding, margins, font sizes, and dimensions must use rem units.**

#### Component Sizing Standards
```css
/* Small elements (buttons, inputs) */
.btn {
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  min-height: 2.5rem;
}

/* Medium elements (cards, sections) */
.card {
  padding: 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

/* Panel content (from working v8 code) */
.panel-content {
  padding: 0.75rem;    /* Tighter padding maximizes content space */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### 6.3 OKLCH Color System

**Base Theme:** Started with TweakCN "Clean Slate" theme, then customized for gaming aesthetics

#### Color System Structure (Dark Theme - MVP Default)
```css
.dark {
  /* Base Colors - Dark gaming aesthetic */
  --background: oklch(0.2077 0.0398 265.7549);
  --foreground: oklch(0.9288 0.0126 255.5078);
  --card: oklch(0.2527 0.0346 274.0597);
  --card-foreground: oklch(0.9288 0.0126 255.5078);
  
  /* Interactive Colors - Blue/purple gaming vibes */
  --primary: oklch(0.6801 0.1583 276.9349);
  --primary-foreground: oklch(0.2077 0.0398 265.7549);
  --secondary: oklch(0.3351 0.0331 260.9120);
  --accent: oklch(0.3729 0.0306 259.7328);
  
  /* Functional Colors */
  --muted: oklch(0.2795 0.0368 260.0310);
  --muted-foreground: oklch(0.7137 0.0192 261.3246);
  --destructive: oklch(0.6368 0.2078 25.3313);
  --border: oklch(0.4461 0.0263 256.8018);
  --input: oklch(0.4461 0.0263 256.8018);
  --ring: oklch(0.6801 0.1583 276.9349);
}
```

#### Why OKLCH?
- **Perceptually uniform** color space
- **Consistent lightness** across hues
- **Future theme support** - Easy to swap color sets later
- **Modern CSS standard** with better browser support
- **Gaming community appropriate** (professional dark theme)

#### Theme Architecture (Post-MVP Ready)
```css
/* Structure supports easy theme additions later */
:root { /* Light theme variables */ }
.dark { /* Dark theme (MVP default) */ }
.theme-cyberpunk { /* Future theme example */ }
.theme-tournament { /* Future theme example */ }
```

**Note:** Light theme CSS included for structure but hidden in MVP. Focus on perfecting dark theme for gaming community.

### 6.4 Component Interaction Patterns

#### Click-to-Select Pattern (No Checkboxes)
**Used throughout the interface for consistency:**
- **Timeslots:** Click empty space = select, click initials = deselect
- **Team cards:** Click card = toggle selection state
- **Templates:** Click template = select for loading
- **Navigation:** Click week header = select entire column

#### Visual Selection Feedback
```css
/* Selected state styling */
.selected {
  background-color: var(--primary);
  color: var(--primary-foreground);
  border-color: var(--primary);
}

/* Hover state for selectables */
.selectable:hover {
  background-color: var(--accent);
  color: var(--accent-foreground);
}
```

#### Overflow Handling Pattern
**When content exceeds available space:**
- **Display:** Show 3-4 items, then `[+X]` button
- **Interaction:** Click `[+X]` opens modal with full list
- **Examples:** Team initials in timeslots, team logos in comparison view

#### Team Management Drawer Pattern (Critical Component)
**This was perfected after much iteration - follow exactly:**

```html
<!-- Drawer must be absolute positioned within panel -->
<div id="team-management-drawer" 
     class="absolute left-0 right-0 bottom-0 bg-slate-800 border border-slate-600 
            rounded-t-lg drawer-closed transition-transform duration-300 ease-out 
            z-30 overflow-hidden"
     style="top: 2.5rem;">
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Positioning:** `absolute` within the panel, NOT fixed to viewport
- **Z-index:** `z-30` ensures it's above panel content but below modals
- **Animation:** CSS transform with transition, NOT JavaScript animations
- **States:** Toggle between `drawer-open` and `drawer-closed` classes
- **Overflow:** Set to `hidden` to prevent content bleeding during animation

**Common AI Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Using `position: fixed` (drawer escapes panel)
- ❌ Animating with JavaScript (causes flicker)
- ❌ Wrong z-index (appears behind content or above modals)
- ❌ Using opacity for show/hide (creates click-through issues)
- ❌ Forgetting overflow hidden (content visible during slide)

### 6.5 Component Layout Patterns

#### Flexible Component Structure
**Each component renders what it needs - no forced structure:**

```javascript
// Simple content-only (Week Navigation)
panel.innerHTML = `
    <div class="flex items-center justify-between px-4 h-full">
        <button>Prev</button>
        <div>Week 28: Jul 7 - Jul 13</div>
        <button>Next</button>
    </div>
`;

// Title + content (Favorites, Browse Teams)
panel.innerHTML = `
    <h3 class="text-base font-semibold mb-3">Favorites</h3>
    <div class="space-y-2 overflow-y-auto">
        <!-- Team cards -->
    </div>
`;

// Custom layout (Team Info with switcher)
panel.innerHTML = `
    <div class="team-switcher mb-3">
        <button class="team-btn active">Team A</button>
        <button class="team-btn">Team B</button>
    </div>
    <div class="team-details">
        <!-- Team information -->
    </div>
    <!-- Drawer component at bottom -->
`;
```

#### Component JavaScript Pattern (Revealing Module)
```javascript
const ComponentName = (() => {
    // Private variables
    let panel;
    let state = {};
    
    // Private functions
    function render() {
        panel.innerHTML = `<!-- Component HTML -->`;
        attachListeners();
    }
    
    function attachListeners() {
        // Event handling
    }
    
    // Public API (what we "reveal")
    return {
        init(panelId) {
            panel = document.getElementById(panelId);
            render();
        },
        update(data) {
            state = data;
            render();
        }
    };
})();
```

#### Key Principles
- **No forced structure** - Components render what they need
- **Direct panel rendering** - Use innerHTML with template literals
- **Event re-attachment** - After each render, re-attach listeners
- **Private state** - Keep component data private inside the module
- **Simple API** - Usually just init() and update() are public

### 6.6 Preserved UI Components

**These components are already perfected and must be preserved in v3:**

#### Team Management Drawer (Fully Working Layout)
**Location:** Team Info panel (middle-left)
**Reference:** `/public/js/components/teamInfo_new_code_V2.js`

**Working Layout for Leaders:**
1. **Join Code Row**: Input field + Copy button + Regenerate button
2. **Max Players Row**: Dropdown selector (1-20 players)
3. **Logo Section**: 5rem square placeholder (ready for logo display)
4. **Action Buttons**:
   - Manage Logo (opens modal)
   - Kick Player (opens selection modal)
   - Transfer Leadership (opens selection modal)
   - Leave Team (disabled unless last player)

**Reused Layout for Members:**
1. **Join Code Row**: Input field + Copy button only (no regenerate)
2. **Max Players Row**: Read-only display
3. **Action Button**: Leave Team only

**Why This Works:**
- Same layout structure for both roles
- Progressive disclosure (members see less)
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- All interactive elements tested and working

#### Logo Upload System
**Backend:** Complete processing pipeline in `/functions/src/teams/logos.js`
**Frontend Status:** 
- Modal structure started but not polished
- Upload flow partially implemented
- Logo display placeholder ready in drawer (5rem square)
- Needs: File picker, upload progress, error handling

#### OKLCH Theme Variables
**File:** `/public/css/styles.css`
**Status:** Complete professional color system (customized from TweakCN)
**Usage:** All components must use these CSS variables

### 6.7 Modal and Overlay Systems

#### Working Modal System from v8
**Reference:** `/public/js/components/modals.js`

**Implemented Modal Types:**
- **Join/Create Team Modal** - Unified onboarding flow ✅
- **Logo Manager Modal** - Functional but needs UI polish
- **Leave Team Modal** - Confirmation with role-specific messaging ✅
- **Transfer Leadership Modal** - Player selection interface ✅
- **Kick Players Modal** - Multi-select with confirmation ✅

#### Modal Structure Pattern
```javascript
const modalHTML = `
    <div class="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-75 z-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4 backdrop-blur-sm">
        <div class="bg-slate-800 border border-slate-700 rounded-lg shadow-xl w-full max-w-[48rem]">
            <!-- Header -->
            <div class="flex items-center justify-between p-4 border-b border-slate-700">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-sky-400">${title}</h2>
                <button class="text-slate-400 hover:text-white">&times;</button>
            </div>
            <!-- Body -->
            <div class="p-4">${content}</div>
            <!-- Footer -->
            <div class="flex items-center justify-end p-4 border-t border-slate-700 gap-3">
                ${buttons}
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
`;
```

#### Modal Behavior Patterns
- **Show/Hide:** `showModal()` / `hideModal()` functions
- **Backdrop click:** Closes modal (already working)
- **Loading states:** Buttons disable with loading text during async ops
- **Error display:** Inline error messages in modal body
- **Memory cleanup:** Destroy Cropper.js instances, clear file inputs

#### Logo Manager Modal (Needs Polish)
**Backend:** Complete and Firebase v11 compliant (see `.context/UI_examples/logos.js`)
**Frontend Status:**
- ✅ Cropper.js integration working
- ✅ File upload to Firebase Storage
- ✅ Triggers Cloud Function processing
- ⚠️ UI needs polish and testing
- ⚠️ Progress indicators during processing
- ⚠️ Error handling for large files/wrong formats

**Note:** Architecture is solid, just needs UI refinement during implementation phase.

### 6.8 Responsive Design Strategy

#### Primary Platform: Desktop Only (MVP)
**The 3x3 grid layout is designed exclusively for desktop gaming setups (1920x1080+)**

#### Why Desktop-Only for MVP:
- **Gaming context**: Players use desktop/laptop for matches
- **Discord integration**: Multi-monitor setups common
- **Complex grid**: Weekly availability needs screen space
- **Team coordination**: Leaders manage from desktop

#### Mobile Considerations (Post-MVP):
- **Not a responsive version** - Would need complete redesign
- **Different UI paradigm**: Single day view, swipe between days
- **Revealing menus**: Hide panels behind gestures
- **Simplified features**: Just availability setting, not full management

#### Basic Overflow Handling:
```css
/* Minimum viable width */
.app-container {
    min-width: 1024px;  /* Force horizontal scroll if needed */
}

/* Prevent layout break */
.main-grid {
    min-width: 85rem;  /* Maintain grid integrity */
}
```

**Note:** Mobile media query included in CSS for future use but not implemented in MVP. Focus on perfecting desktop experience first.

### 6.9 Animation and Transitions

#### Minimal Animation Philosophy
**Keep it simple and functional - animations should enhance, not distract**

#### Currently Implemented Animations
```css
/* Drawer slide animation (300ms sweet spot) */
.drawer-closed {
    transform: translateY(calc(100% - 2rem));
}
.drawer-open {
    transform: translateY(0);
}
.transition-transform {
    transition: transform 300ms ease-out;
}

/* Button hover states */
.btn:hover {
    background-color: var(--primary-hover);
    transition: background-color 200ms;
}

/* Arrow rotation for drawer */
.drawer-arrow {
    transition: transform 300ms;
}
```

#### Potential Animation Enhancements (Nice to Have)
```css
/* Week switching animation (currently instant) */
.week-transition {
    animation: slideIn 300ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideIn {
    from { opacity: 0; transform: translateX(20px); }
    to { opacity: 1; transform: translateX(0); }
}

/* Selection feedback */
.cell-selected {
    animation: pulse 200ms ease-out;
}
```

#### Animation Guidelines
- **300ms duration** - Fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to see
- **ease-out timing** - Natural deceleration
- **transform over position** - Better performance with GPU acceleration
- **No animations during data updates** - Avoid jank during Firebase operations

**Note:** Current implementation keeps animations minimal. The drawer is the only major animated element, which helps maintain focus on functionality over flash.

### 6.10 Gaming Community UX Considerations

#### Real Tournament Workflow
**Typical timeline:**
- **Group stages**: Schedule known 1-2 months ahead
- **Playoffs**: Schedule known 1-2 weeks ahead
- **Coordination**: Teams reach out to opponents early, negotiate times
- **Challenge**: Teams aren't in same Discord channels/circles

#### Two Primary Use Cases (Equal Priority)
**1. Internal Team Coordination (Likely Most Used):**
- See when all teammates are available
- Identify best practice times
- Quick overview for team leaders
- "Do we have enough players Tuesday night?"

**2. Opponent Comparison (The Original Vision):**
- Compare availability with specific opponents
- Find overlapping time slots
- Contact other team leader
- "When can we both field full teams?"

#### UX Features That Support Both
**For Internal Use:**
- Clear visual density (many players in one slot = good practice time)
- Quick filtering by player count
- Week-at-a-glance overview

**For Match Scheduling:**
- Easy opponent selection from favorites
- Visual match indicators in comparison mode
- Leader contact info readily available
- Copy-friendly match details for Discord sharing

#### Intentionally Limited Scope (MVP)
**What we're NOT building (yet):**
- Tournament bracket integration
- Automated match reporting
- League standings
- Community-wide calendars

**Focus**: Do one thing perfectly - help teams find when they can play.

### 6.11 Implementation Requirements

#### Development Workflow
1. **Generate theme** using TweakCN editor
2. **Install CSS variables** in main stylesheet
3. **Configure Tailwind** to use theme variables
4. **Follow component patterns** for all new components
5. **Test scaling** across multiple viewport sizes

#### Quality Assurance
- **Viewport testing:** 1366px (laptop) to 2560px (large monitor)
- **Color contrast:** Accessibility compliance
- **Performance:** Smooth animations at 60fps
- **Consistency:** All components follow established patterns

**🔑 Critical Success Factor:** The sacred 3x3 grid with hybrid scaling is the foundation of all UI work. Components must fit within their assigned panels and use rem units for all sizing.

## 7. Error Handling & User Feedback

### 7.1 Error Categories & Gaming Context

#### User Input Errors (Gaming Community Specific)
**Team Creation Errors:**
- **Invalid team names**: "Team names must be 3-30 characters, no special characters"
- **Duplicate team tags**: "Team tag 'EQL' already exists, try 'EQL2' or 'EQLX'"
- **Join code failures**: "Join code 'ABC123' not found or expired"
- **Character limits**: Team names (30 chars), initials (3 chars), team tags (4 chars)

**Gaming Workflow Errors:**
- **Two-team limit**: "You can only join 2 teams maximum (clan + draft team)"
- **Invalid availability**: "Cannot set availability for past dates"
- **Initials conflicts**: "Initials 'ABC' already taken on this team"
- **Leader-only actions**: "Only team leaders can remove players"

#### Permission Errors (Community Dynamics)
**Team Management Restrictions:**
- **Leadership transfer**: "Cannot transfer leadership to yourself"
- **Player removal**: "Cannot remove yourself - transfer leadership first"
- **Join code access**: "You must be a team member to see the join code"
- **Max players exceeded**: "Team is full (10/10 players)"

**Gaming Community Rules:**
- **Inactive team joining**: "This team has been inactive for 14+ days"
- **Tournament deadlines**: "Cannot modify availability after tournament deadline"
- **Discord linking required**: "Link Discord account to contact other team leaders"

#### System Errors (Firebase v11 Specific)
**Network Connectivity:**
- **Offline mode**: "Working offline - changes will sync when reconnected"
- **Sync conflicts**: "Your changes conflict with recent updates - please refresh"
- **Firebase service down**: "Scheduling service temporarily unavailable"
- **Real-time listener failures**: "Live updates paused - refresh to see latest data"

**Performance Issues:**
- **Slow operations**: "This is taking longer than expected - please wait"
- **Cache corruption**: "Data may be outdated - refresh to reload"
- **Memory constraints**: "Browser memory low - some features may be slower"

### 7.2 Optimistic Update Rollback System

**Core Pattern for Hot Paths:**
All hot path operations (availability updates, team switching) use optimistic updates with automatic rollback on failure.

#### Availability Update Pattern
```javascript
// Example: Adding availability optimistically
const AvailabilityManager = {
    async toggleSlot(slot, action) {
        // 1. Capture current state for rollback
        const rollbackState = this.captureSlotState(slot);
        
        // 2. Apply optimistic update immediately
        this.updateUIOptimistically(slot, action);
        
        // 3. Attempt Firebase update
        try {
            await this.updateFirebase(slot, action);
            this.confirmOptimisticUpdate(slot);
        } catch (error) {
            // 4. Rollback on failure
            this.rollbackSlotState(slot, rollbackState);
            this.showError('Failed to update availability - changes reverted');
        }
    },
    
    captureSlotState(slot) {
        return {
            slot,
            previousPlayers: [...(availabilityGrid[slot] || [])],
            timestamp: Date.now()
        };
    },
    
    rollbackSlotState(slot, rollbackState) {
        availabilityGrid[slot] = rollbackState.previousPlayers;
        this.renderSlot(slot);
        
        // Visual feedback for rollback
        this.highlightSlotError(slot);
        setTimeout(() => this.clearSlotError(slot), 3000);
    }
};
```

#### Team Switching Rollback
```javascript
// Example: Team switching with rollback
const TeamSwitcher = {
    async switchTeam(newTeamId) {
        const rollbackState = {
            previousTeamId: StateService.getState('currentTeam'),
            previousTeamData: StateService.getState('teamData'),
            previousAvailability: StateService.getState('availabilityData')
        };
        
        // Optimistic switch
        this.updateUIForTeam(newTeamId);
        
        try {
            await this.loadTeamData(newTeamId);
            this.confirmTeamSwitch(newTeamId);
        } catch (error) {
            // Rollback to previous team
            this.rollbackToTeam(rollbackState);
            this.showError('Failed to switch teams - reverted to previous team');
        }
    }
};
```

### 7.3 Firebase v11 Connection Recovery

#### Network State Monitoring
```javascript
// Firebase v11 connection monitoring
import { 
    enableNetwork, 
    disableNetwork, 
    waitForPendingWrites,
    onSnapshotsInSync 
} from 'firebase/firestore';

const ConnectionManager = {
    isOnline: navigator.onLine,
    pendingWrites: 0,
    
    async init() {
        // Monitor browser connectivity
        window.addEventListener('online', () => this.handleOnline());
        window.addEventListener('offline', () => this.handleOffline());
        
        // Monitor Firebase sync status
        onSnapshotsInSync(db, () => {
            this.showSyncStatus('Synced with server');
            this.clearPendingIndicators();
        });
    },
    
    async handleOffline() {
        this.isOnline = false;
        await disableNetwork(db);
        this.showPersistentMessage('Working offline - changes will sync when reconnected', 'warning');
    },
    
    async handleOnline() {
        this.isOnline = true;
        try {
            await enableNetwork(db);
            await waitForPendingWrites(db);
            this.showSuccessMessage('Back online - all changes synced');
        } catch (error) {
            this.showError('Failed to reconnect - refresh page if problems persist');
        }
    }
};
```

#### Listener Recovery System
```javascript
// Automatic listener recovery
const ListenerManager = {
    activeListeners: new Map(),
    
    setupResilientListener(docRef, callback, componentName) {
        const listener = onSnapshot(
            docRef,
            { includeMetadataChanges: true },
            (doc) => {
                if (doc.metadata.fromCache && !doc.metadata.hasPendingWrites) {
                    this.showCacheWarning(componentName);
                }
                callback(doc);
            },
            (error) => {
                console.error(`${componentName} listener error:`, error);
                this.scheduleListenerRecovery(docRef, callback, componentName);
            }
        );
        
        this.activeListeners.set(componentName, listener);
        return listener;
    },
    
    scheduleListenerRecovery(docRef, callback, componentName) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if (this.activeListeners.has(componentName)) {
                console.log(`Reconnecting ${componentName} listener`);
                this.setupResilientListener(docRef, callback, componentName);
            }
        }, 5000); // Retry after 5 seconds
    }
};
```

### 7.4 Gaming Community Feedback Patterns

#### Tournament Context Messages
```javascript
// Tournament deadline pressure messaging
const TournamentMessaging = {
    showDeadlineWarning(hoursRemaining) {
        if (hoursRemaining <= 24) {
            return this.showUrgentMessage(
                `Match deadline in ${hoursRemaining} hours! Schedule now to avoid forfeit.`,
                'destructive'
            );
        }
        if (hoursRemaining <= 72) {
            return this.showWarning(
                `Match deadline approaching (${hoursRemaining} hours). Coordinate with opponent soon.`
            );
        }
    },
    
    showSchedulingSuccess(opponentTeam, timeSlot) {
        return this.showSuccess(
            `Match scheduled with ${opponentTeam} for ${timeSlot}. Post in Discord to confirm!`
        );
    }
};
```

#### Discord Integration Feedback
```javascript
// Discord-specific user feedback
const DiscordFeedback = {
    showContactInstructions(leaderName) {
        return this.showInfo(
            `Contact ${leaderName} on Discord to confirm match time. Click to copy username.`
        );
    },
    
    showSharingSuccess(teamName) {
        return this.showSuccess(
            `Join code for ${teamName} copied! Share in Discord for teammates to join.`
        );
    }
};
```

### 7.5 Loading States (Hot vs Cold Paths)

#### Hot Path Loading (Minimal/None)
**Performance Requirement: < 50ms - No loading states needed**
```javascript
// Hot paths should never show loading
const HotPathOperations = {
    // ✅ No loading state - instant from cache
    switchTeam(teamId) {
        this.updateUIFromCache(teamId);
    },
    
    // ✅ Optimistic update - instant UI response
    toggleAvailability(slot) {
        this.updateUIOptimistically(slot);
        this.syncToFirebase(slot); // Background sync
    },
    
    // ✅ Pre-loaded data - instant navigation
    navigateWeek(offset) {
        this.renderWeekFromCache(offset);
    }
};
```

#### Cold Path Loading (Acceptable)
**Performance Requirement: < 2s - Loading states expected**
```javascript
// Cold paths can show loading states
const ColdPathOperations = {
    async createTeam(teamData) {
        // Show loading immediately
        this.showLoadingState('Creating team...', teamData.teamName);
        
        try {
            const result = await this.firebaseCreateTeam(teamData);
            this.showSuccessMessage(`Team "${teamData.teamName}" created!`);
            return result;
        } catch (error) {
            this.showError(`Failed to create team: ${error.message}`);
            throw error;
        } finally {
            this.hideLoadingState();
        }
    },
    
    async uploadLogo(file) {
        const progress = this.showProgressIndicator('Uploading logo...');
        
        try {
            await this.firebaseUploadLogo(file, (percent) => {
                progress.update(percent);
            });
            this.showSuccessMessage('Logo uploaded successfully!');
        } catch (error) {
            this.showError(`Logo upload failed: ${error.message}`);
        } finally {
            progress.hide();
        }
    }
};
```

### 7.6 Error Recovery Strategies

#### Automatic Recovery (Silent)
```javascript
const AutoRecovery = {
    // Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
    async retryOperation(operation, maxRetries = 3) {
        let retryCount = 0;
        
        while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
            try {
                return await operation();
            } catch (error) {
                retryCount++;
                if (retryCount >= maxRetries) throw error;
                
                // Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s
                await this.sleep(Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000);
            }
        }
    },
    
    // Recover from authentication errors
    async handleAuthError(error) {
        if (error.code === 'auth/token-expired') {
            try {
                await AuthService.refreshToken();
                return true; // Retry the operation
            } catch (refreshError) {
                this.showError('Session expired - please log in again');
                AuthService.logout();
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

#### User-Initiated Recovery
```javascript
const UserRecovery = {
    // Refresh button for stale data
    showRefreshOption(componentName) {
        return this.showActionMessage(
            `${componentName} data may be outdated`,
            'Refresh',
            () => this.refreshComponent(componentName)
        );
    },
    
    // Clear cache option for persistent problems
    showClearCacheOption() {
        return this.showActionMessage(
            'Having issues? Try clearing cached data',
            'Clear Cache',
            () => this.clearAllCache()
        );
    }
};
```

### 7.7 Toast Notification System

#### Gaming Community Toast Types
```javascript
const ToastSystem = {
    // Success messages (green) - Gaming context
    showSuccess(message, duration = 3000) {
        return this.show(message, 'success', duration);
    },
    
    // Warning messages (yellow) - Tournament deadlines
    showWarning(message, duration = 5000) {
        return this.show(message, 'warning', duration);
    },
    
    // Error messages (red) - Action failures
    showError(message, duration = 7000) {
        return this.show(message, 'error', duration);
    },
    
    // Info messages (blue) - Instructions
    showInfo(message, duration = 4000) {
        return this.show(message, 'info', duration);
    },
    
    // Persistent messages - Offline mode
    showPersistent(message, type = 'warning') {
        return this.show(message, type, 0); // 0 = no auto-dismiss
    }
};
```

### 7.8 Empty States (Gaming Community)

#### No Teams Joined
```html
<div class="empty-state">
    <h3>Ready to schedule some matches?</h3>
    <p>Join your team or create a new one to get started</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="showOnboardingModal()">
        Join or Create Team
    </button>
</div>
```

#### No Availability Set
```html
<div class="empty-state">
    <h3>Set your availability</h3>
    <p>Click time slots to show when you're available for matches</p>
    <p class="text-muted">Your teammates are counting on you!</p>
</div>
```

#### No Match Results
```html
<div class="empty-state">
    <h3>No matches found</h3>
    <p>Try adjusting your minimum player requirements or ask opponent teams to update their availability</p>
    <button class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="refreshComparison()">
        Refresh Comparison
    </button>
</div>
```

### 7.9 Accessibility & User Experience

#### Screen Reader Support
```javascript
// Announce important state changes
const A11yAnnouncer = {
    announceOptimisticUpdate(slot, action) {
        this.announce(`${action === 'add' ? 'Added to' : 'Removed from'} ${slot}`);
    },
    
    announceError(message) {
        this.announce(message, 'assertive'); // Interrupt current reading
    },
    
    announceSuccess(message) {
        this.announce(message, 'polite'); // Wait for current reading
    }
};
```

#### Keyboard Navigation
```javascript
// Error recovery via keyboard
const KeyboardRecovery = {
    handleKeyPress(event) {
        if (event.key === 'Escape') {
            this.clearAllErrors();
            this.focusMainContent();
        }
        
        if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === 'r') {
            event.preventDefault();
            this.refreshCurrentView();
        }
    }
};
```

### 7.10 Error Logging & Monitoring

#### Structured Error Logging
```javascript
const ErrorLogger = {
    logError(error, context) {
        const errorData = {
            message: error.message,
            stack: error.stack,
            context,
            userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            userId: AuthService.getCurrentUserId(),
            teamId: StateService.getState('currentTeam')
        };
        
        // Log to console for development
        console.error('MatchScheduler Error:', errorData);
        
        // Send to monitoring service (post-MVP)
        if (window.Sentry) {
            window.Sentry.captureException(error, { extra: errorData });
        }
    }
};
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
const PerformanceMonitor = {
    measureOperation(operationName, operation) {
        const startTime = performance.now();
        
        return operation().finally(() => {
            const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
            
            // Log slow operations
            if (duration > 100) {
                console.warn(`Slow operation: ${operationName} took ${duration}ms`);
            }
            
            // Track performance metrics
            if (window.gtag) {
                window.gtag('event', 'timing_complete', {
                    name: operationName,
                    value: Math.round(duration)
                });
            }
        });
    }
};
```

### 7.11 Implementation Guidelines

#### Error Handling Priorities
1. **Hot paths**: Optimistic updates with silent rollback
2. **Cold paths**: Loading states with error recovery
3. **Network issues**: Automatic retry with user feedback
4. **Authentication**: Silent refresh with fallback to login
5. **Data conflicts**: User-guided resolution

#### Gaming Community Messaging
- **Use familiar gaming terms**: "Team", "Match", "Opponent", "Tournament"
- **Reference Discord workflows**: "Share in Discord", "Contact via Discord"
- **Acknowledge deadlines**: "Tournament deadline approaching"
- **Encourage team coordination**: "Your teammates are counting on you"

#### Testing Requirements
- **Offline functionality**: Disable network, verify graceful degradation
- **Connection recovery**: Simulate network interruption and restoration
- **Optimistic rollback**: Force Firebase failures, verify UI reverts
- **Error message clarity**: Test with non-technical gaming community users

**🔑 Success Metrics:** 
- **Hot paths feel instant** even with network issues
- **Users understand all error messages** in gaming context
- **Automatic recovery** handles 90% of connection problems
- **Manual recovery options** available for edge cases

## Implementation Notes for AI Development

### Architecture Philosophy (Based on Lessons Learned)
**Avoid the "Warehouse StateService" Pattern:**
- Previous v8 approach: 400+ line central StateService managing all data distribution
- New v11 approach: Each UI component subscribes directly to what it needs
- Event log listener only for coordination events, not data distribution
- **Result:** Simpler debugging, faster performance, less code

### Component Patterns
**Each Component Self-Contained:**
```javascript
// TeamInfo listens directly to what it needs
onSnapshot(doc(db, 'teams', teamId), (doc) => {
  TeamInfo.updateUI(doc.data()); // Direct, no middleware
});

// Event coordination (not data distribution)
onSnapshot(collection(db, 'eventLog'), (snapshot) => {
  EventHandler.route(event); // Simple routing to affected components
});
```

### Data Flow Strategy
1. **App Load:** Batch fetch all team basic info (instant browsing)
2. **Real-time:** Single event log listener (catches all system changes)  
3. **Availability:** Direct listeners only for teams user cares about
4. **No Complex State:** Components own their data, coordinate via events

### Performance Priorities
- **Hot Paths (< 50ms):** Availability updates, team switching, week navigation
- **Cold Paths (< 2s):** Team operations, profile updates, logo uploads
- **Caching:** Aggressive for browsing, selective for real-time data
