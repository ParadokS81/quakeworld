# MatchScheduler Implementation Roadmap v3

## Overview
Vertical slice implementation strategy. Each slice delivers complete working functionality.
Detailed specifications in `/context/slices/[slice-name].md`

## Sequencing Rationale
- **Part 1:** Can't do anything without authenticated users and teams
- **Part 2:** Core value prop - individual then team availability  
- **Part 3:** Network effect features require Part 2 data
- **Part 4:** Polish after core features proven

## Performance Requirements
- **Part 1:** Authentication < 2s (cold path)
- **Part 2:** Availability updates < 50ms (hot path)
- **Part 3:** Comparison < 50ms setup, < 2s results
- **Part 4:** Maintain all performance

**Note:** Foundation for QW Hub integration. Browse Teams panel (bottom-right) drives team selection.

### ✅ Slice 5.1a: QW Hub Tag Configuration
**Status:** Complete (Revised)
**User Value:** Team tags match QW in-game identity, enabling match history lookups
**Components:** TeamService (modify), team-operations Cloud Function (modify), seed scripts
**Scope:**
- ~~Separate `qwHubTag` field~~ → Merged into existing `teamTag`
- Relaxed `teamTag` validation: case-sensitive, allows QW special chars (`[]()-_.,!`), 1-4 chars
- Seed scripts use real QW Hub tags (e.g., `]SR[`, `GoF!`, `tSQ`)
- No UI changes needed — leaders set teamTag at team creation

**Note:** During implementation, discovered that QW Hub tags and in-game tags are the same thing. Simplified by using `teamTag` directly for hub lookups instead of maintaining a separate field.

### ✅ Slice 5.1b: Team Match History (Basic)
**Status:** Complete
**User Value:** See a team's recent match results from QW Hub
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-5.1b-team-match-history.md`
**Components:** QWHubService (new), TeamsBrowserPanel (enhance)
**Scope:**
- Fetch recent 4on4 matches using team's `teamTag` for QW Hub API lookup
- Display in team detail view with hub-style scoreboard rendering
- Click match row to toggle inline scoreboard with mapshot background
- "View on QW Hub" link, loading/error/retry states
- QW color palette, colored names, country flags

**Note:** Superseded by Slice 5.2 cluster for enhanced UX, but core QWHubService and scoreboard rendering remain.

### Slice 5.2: Team Detail Redesign (Tab Cluster)

Redesign of the team detail view with tabbed navigation, richer landing page, split-panel match history, stats popout, and head-to-head comparison. Supersedes 5.1b layout and 5.1c entirely.

#### ✅ Slice 5.2a: Team Details Landing Page
**Status:** Complete
**User Value:** Rich team identity page with logo, roster, and auto-generated activity stats
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-5.2a-team-details-landing.md`
**Components:** TeamsBrowserPanel (enhance), QWHubService (enhance)
**Scope:**
- Tabbed sub-navigation: [Details] [Match History] [Head to Head]
- Details tab: Hero logo (11rem), team name + division in right-side header, roster with avatars
- Two-column layout: identity left (logo + roster), activity right (map stats + upcoming)
- Map activity summary: matches per map with W-L record (last 6 months, auto-generated from QWHub)
- New `getTeamMapStats()` method in QWHubService (50 matches, client-side aggregation)
- "Compare H2H" button navigates to Head to Head tab
- Upcoming games placeholder section

**Note:** Seed scripts updated with correct QWHub clan tags for all 24 teams. Record format uses compact W-L dash format (green-red coloring). Teams without QWHub tags show "Match history not available".

#### ✅ Slice 5.2b: Match History Split-Panel
**Status:** Complete
**User Value:** Browse match history with filters and preview scoreboards by hover/click
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-5.2b-match-history-split-panel.md`
**Components:** TeamsBrowserPanel (enhance)
**Scope:**
- Left panel (38%): Scrollable match list with map/opponent/period filters, sortable columns, up to 20 matches
- Right panel (62%): Scoreboard preview area with mapshot background
- Hover = instant preview (from cached Supabase data), Click = sticky + fetch ktxstats
- Activity chart + map/opponent breakdown in summary view
- "View on QW Hub" game link + "Full Stats" button

**Note:** Split ratio tuned from original 40/60 to 38/62 for better stats table fit at 1080p.

#### ✅ Slice 5.2c: Inline Stats Table (Revised from Popout Modal)
**Status:** Complete
**User Value:** Per-player match stats rendered inline on map background with 3 toggleable tabs
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-5.2c-stats-popout-modal.md` (original spec — implementation pivoted to inline)
**Components:** TeamsBrowserPanel (enhance), QWHubService (enhance)
**Scope:**
- Unified stats-on-map view: stats table rendered on map background with dark overlay + text-outline
- 3 tabs: Performance (Eff%, Deaths, Dmg, EWEP, ToDie), Weapons (SG%, RL t/d, LG%/t/d), Resources (GA, YA, RA, MH, Q, P, R)
- Team aggregate rows + per-player rows grouped by team, sorted by frags
- Hub-style colored headers (armor/powerup colors), dimmed zeros, red-to-orange team dividers
- QW byte-encoded name rendering via new `coloredQuakeNameFromBytes()`
- Hover shows classic scoreboard, click transitions to unified stats view
- "View on QW Hub" + "Full Stats" links inside overlay

**Note:** Originally planned as draggable popout modal for side-by-side comparison. Pivoted to inline stats-on-map view — simpler, eliminates redundant scoreboard, and the map background gives each match visual identity. Popout can be added later if comparison use case demands it.

#### 📅 Slice 5.2d: Head-to-Head Tab
**Status:** Not Started
**User Value:** Compare two teams' H2H record with stats, map breakdown, and match list
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-5.2d-head-to-head-tab.md`

**Scope:**
- H2H tab in team detail navigation, pre-selects current team
- Searchable opponent dropdown (teams with QWHub tags)
- Overall W/L record, per-map breakdown with win bars
- Match list with click-to-view stats (reuses 5.2c MatchStatsModal)
- New `getH2HMatches()` method in QWHubService (sorted cache key)

---

## Part 5b: Cross-Timezone Support

### ✅ Slice 7.0: UTC Timezone Foundation
**Status:** Complete
**User Value:** Players in any timezone see local evening times while availability is stored in UTC, enabling correct cross-timezone comparison
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-7.0-utc-timezone-foundation.md`
**Components:** TimezoneService (new), AvailabilityGrid (modify), WeekNavigation (modify), WeekDisplay (modify), ComparisonModal (modify), OverflowModal (modify), Cloud Functions (modify), seed scripts (modify)
**Scope:**
- TimezoneService with IANA timezone support, DST-aware via Intl API
- All Firestore slot IDs stored as UTC
- Grid displays local time labels (18:00-23:00 in user's timezone)
- Day wrapping for negative-offset timezones (e.g., EST Mon 21:00 → UTC Tue 02:00)
- Timezone selector UI in grid header (grouped by region)
- Auto-detect timezone from browser, persist to user document
- Cloud Function validation updated to accept any UTC hour (00-23)
- Seed script generates UTC-based slot data
- Templates store UTC slot IDs
- Modals display times in user's local timezone

**Note:** All 7 test suites pass (offset calculation, local→UTC, UTC→local, day wrapping, grid map round-trip, boundary offsets, display formatting). ComparisonEngine unchanged — already compares slot ID strings.

---

### 📅 Slice 5.3: Tournament Hub Tab
**Status:** Not Started
**User Value:** See tournament deadlines and quick-compare against opponents
**Components:** TournamentHubPanel (new)
**Scope:** Tournament list, deadline warnings, preset comparison groups

## Part 7: Match Scheduling

### ✅ Slice 8.0: Match Proposals & Scheduling
**Status:** Complete
**User Value:** Leaders/schedulers can propose matches to opponents, auto-see viable slots, and confirm to schedule — no more manual grid scanning
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-8.0-match-proposals.md`
**Components:** MatchesPanel (new), ProposalService (new), ScheduledMatchService (new), UpcomingMatchesPanel (new), Cloud Functions (new)
**Sub-slices (all complete):**
- 8.0a: Schema + Cloud Functions + Scheduler Delegation (`schedulers[]` on team doc, matchProposals + scheduledMatches collections, create/confirm/cancel)
- 8.0b: "Matches" tab in center panel + proposal cards with live slot updates + blocked-slot filtering + countAtConfirm warnings
- 8.0c: "Propose Match" button in ComparisonModal + Discord template generation (leaders + schedulers)
- Upcoming Matches: UpcomingMatchesPanel in bottom-left with "Your Matches" + "Community Matches" sections
**Key Design:** Proposals store team pairing + min-vs-min filter, slots computed LIVE from availability data. Leaders or delegated schedulers confirm slots; both sides confirm same slot → match scheduled automatically. Confirmed slot blocked for both teams in other proposals. No cooldown or rate limits (monitor first). Past slots hidden, proposals degrade gracefully.

**Note:** All 5 Cloud Functions implemented (createProposal, confirmSlot, withdrawConfirmation, cancelProposal, toggleScheduler). Full frontend integration with cache+listener pattern, loading states, error handling.

### 📅 Slice 8.1: Reactive Comparison Mode + Shared DateUtils
**Status:** Spec Complete
**Dependencies:** Slice 8.0, Slice 3.4

**User Value:** Teams can hide roster names from comparison (strategic privacy) or hide entirely from public comparison
**Components:** TeamManagementModal, ComparisonEngine, ComparisonModal, AvailabilityGrid, updateTeamSettings CF

**Sub-slices:**
- 9.0a: Modal layout compaction (Tag+Max on one row, logo+schedulers side-by-side, action buttons side-by-side)
- 9.0b: Privacy settings (hideRosterNames + hideFromComparison toggles, backend, comparison filtering)

**Scope:**
- Toggle: hide roster nicks from comparison (show "3 players" instead of names)
- Toggle: hide team from public comparison entirely (internal-only availability tool)
- Both are boolean flags on team document
- ComparisonEngine filters hidden teams and anonymizes rosters
- ComparisonModal + AvailabilityGrid tooltips render anonymous summaries
- updateTeamSettings Cloud Function extended for privacy fields

---

**Note:** Drawer struggled with variable content height. Modal handles complex content better. Grid Tools drawer has bounded content (max 4-5 rows) - ideal for drawer pattern.

---

## Part 9: Mobile Responsive

### Slice 10.0: Mobile Responsive Layout

Landscape-focused single-column layout. Side panels hidden, content moved to swipe-in drawers (left=team info, right=browser+favorites). Bottom bar merges divider tabs with week navigation. Desktop layout completely untouched — purely additive CSS media queries.

#### ✅ Slice 10.0a: CSS Foundation
**Status:** Complete
**User Value:** Mobile breakpoint established, grid collapses to single column
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-10.0a-mobile-css-foundation.md`
**Components:** src/css/input.css, public/index.html

**Scope:** Fav/Div filtering in right drawer, toast/button repositioning

---

## Progress Summary
**Slices Complete:** 35 / ~47

## Current Focus
**Slice 8.1 - Reactive Comparison Mode** — Refactor comparison to auto-update on team selection changes, extract shared DateUtils. Then continue with mobile slices 10.0d/e.

## QW Hub Integration Path
5.1 → 5.1a → 5.1b (basic) → ✅ 5.2a → ✅ 5.2b → ✅ 5.2c → **5.2d** (full redesign)

Each 5.2 slice builds on the previous:
- 5.2a: Tab infrastructure + Details landing page (foundation)
- 5.2b: Match History split-panel (requires 5.2a tabs)
- 5.2c: Stats popout modal (requires 5.2b "Full Stats" button)
- 5.2d: H2H tab (requires 5.2a tabs, reuses 5.2b/c patterns)
