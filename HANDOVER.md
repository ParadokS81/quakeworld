# Handover

Dynamic backlog of deferred items from prior wrap-up sessions. Entries get added during the `docs-check` skill's Step 7.5 triage when a finding is judgment-heavy or substantial enough that addressing it inline would bloat the current session. Entries get **deleted** (not struck through) when resolved.

This file is referenced from `MEMORY.md` so every new session sees the open-items count at context load. Memory is for durable facts; this file is for todo state. Do not move entries back into memory when they age — either resolve them or leave them here.

**How to work an item:** pick one from the Open items index below, find its section in this file, verify the described state still matches reality (code changes quickly, handover notes can rot), then address it. When done, delete both the index line AND the section. Do not leave resolved items struck through.

## Open items

- [qw-oracle/CLAUDE.md is 192 lines (over 150 hard ceiling)](#qw-oraclecladuemd-is-192-lines-over-150-hard-ceiling) — split into Layer 2 docs next time qw-oracle gets active work

---

## qw-oracle/CLAUDE.md is 192 lines (over 150 hard ceiling)

**Added:** 2026-04-14
**Status:** pending, expect to address when qw-oracle gets its next active session
**Verification first:** `wc -l apps/qw-oracle/CLAUDE.md`. If under 150, this item is resolved (someone already split it or trimmed it).

The monorepo doc philosophy puts a soft ceiling at 120 lines and a hard ceiling at 150 lines on any `CLAUDE.md`. Bloat is diagnostic: the cause is almost always a missing Layer 2 doc that should be holding the overflow content. `apps/qw-oracle/CLAUDE.md` is currently 192 lines, 28% over the hard ceiling.

The POC implementation plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-14-qw-knowledge-service-poc.md` includes rewriting `apps/qw-oracle/CLAUDE.md` in Task 1 as part of the three-layer scaffolding. That task will naturally trim the file AND create the Layer 2 docs (`layers/README.md`, `serve/README.md`, etc.) that should hold the content currently stuffed into CLAUDE.md.

### Fix shape

Don't split preemptively. The POC plan already handles it — Task 1 in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-14-qw-knowledge-service-poc.md` rewrites `apps/qw-oracle/CLAUDE.md` to the three-layer structure and creates the overflow docs. When that task lands, this handover item should resolve automatically. Only revisit if the POC plan stalls and qw-oracle/CLAUDE.md stays bloated for an extended period.
